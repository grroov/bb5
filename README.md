# Big Bang Customer Template

> _This is a mirror of a government repo hosted on [Repo1](https://repo1.dso.mil/) by [DoD Platform One](http://p1.dso.mil/). Please direct all code changes, issues and comments to <https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/customers/template>_

If you are new to Big Bang, it is recommended you start with the [Big Bang Quickstart Guide](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/blob/master/docs/guides/deployment-scenarios/quickstart.md) before customizing this template.

This repository provides a template for managing your Big Bang configurations using Kustomize and GitOps principles with FluxCD. It helps isolate your custom configuration from the core Big Bang product, allowing for easier upgrades and better change management.

## Prerequisites

Before using this template, ensure you have:

- A Kubernetes cluster [ready for Big Bang](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/tree/master/docs/prerequisites).
- `kubectl` installed and configured to access your cluster
- `flux` cli installed
- `git` installed
- `gpg` installed for SOPS encryption
- `sops` installed for managing secrets. See [SOPS Installation Guide](https://github.com/mozilla/sops#installation).
- An account on [Repo1](https://repo1.dso.mil) with a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `read_repository` scope
- Credentials for [Iron Bank](https://registry1.dso.mil) (Username and PAT/CLI Secret)
- An empty Git repository on [Repo1](https://repo1.dso.mil) that you can commit to

## Core Concepts

### Kustomize

This template uses Kustomize to manage Kubernetes configurations. It employs a base/overlay structure where common settings reside in `base/` and environment-specific configurations are placed in overlay directories (e.g., `dev/`, `prod/`).

### GitOps

All configurations are stored in your Git repository. FluxCD runs in your cluster, monitors your repository, and automatically applies changes.

### Fluxing the Flux

Both `gitRepo/` and `helmRepo/` include a `flux-components` Kustomization in `base/` that reconciles Big Bang's Flux manifests from `./base/flux`.

- `gitRepo/`: Flux components follow the Big Bang version pinned in `base/kustomization.yaml` (`resources: .../bigbang.git/base?ref=X.Y.Z`).
- `helmRepo/`: Flux components use `GitRepository/bigbang`, and the Git tag is automatically synced from `base/helmrelease.yaml` `spec.chart.spec.version`.

This means Flux controllers are managed continuously by Flux after initial bootstrap.

### Repository Structure

This template is organized into two deployment strategy folders:

- **`gitRepo/`**: Contains configurations for GitOps deployment using Big Bang's Git repository as the source
- **`helmRepo/`**: Contains configurations for deployment using Big Bang's OCI Helm chart from the registry

Each strategy folder contains:

- `base/`: Common Kustomize resources, configurations (`configmap.yaml`), and encrypted secrets (`common-bb-secret.enc.yaml`) shared across all environments
- `dev/`: Configurations specific to a development environment
- `staging/`: Configurations specific to a staging environment (helmRepo only)
- `prod/`: Configurations specific to a production environment (helmRepo only)

### Deployment Methods

#### gitRepo (Recommended)

The **gitRepo** strategy deploys Big Bang by referencing the upstream Big Bang Git repository directly as a Kustomize base.

**Use when:** You want a straightforward deployment with minimal complexity, or you're new to Big Bang

#### helmRepo

The **helmRepo** strategy deploys Big Bang using the OCI Helm chart from registry1.dso.mil.

**Use when:** You need to deploy in air-gapped environments, or require strict control over chart sources

### Git Repository Best Practices

### Deploying Clusters Across Multiple Impact Levels

When deploying clusters across various Impact Levels (ILs), it’s important to follow these best practices to maintain appropriate data segregation and minimize risk:

#### Repository Separation

- Maintain a **dedicated Git repository for each Impact Level** where clusters will be deployed.
- Ensure that the **repository’s hosting environment matches the cluster’s impact level**.

**Example:** A Git repository managing infrastructure for an **IL4 cluster** must be hosted within an **IL4-approved environment**. Avoid hosting IL4 infrastructure-as-code (IaC) in an **IL2 repository**, as this presents security and compliance concerns.

#### Handling Controlled Information

- Infrastructure code for IL4 or IL5 may contain **Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)**, requiring it to be **isolated from lower ILs**.
- Even if IL2 and IL4 repositories use encryption, **separation is best practice** — especially when server-side Git hooks are not enforced, which increases the risk of accidentally committing unencrypted secrets.
- Shared directories like `/base` can unintentionally propagate encrypted secrets across ILs if not managed carefully.

#### Purpose and Use of The `/base` Directory

The `/base` folder is intended for sharing common configurations and secrets among clusters operating at the same Impact Level.
The intent of the `/base` folder is to allow common configurations and in some cases secrets to be shared between clusters.

##### Proper use examples

- **IL2 clusters** (e.g., sandbox, development, and test) can share configuration through `/base`.
- **IL4 environments** (e.g., production and acceptance) might share an image pull secret using /base.
- Ensure that `/base` is **never** used to share secrets across different Impact Levels to avoid data leakage or policy violations.

### Additional notes on multi-cluster usage

While these best practices cover most scenarios, **Authorizing Officials (AOs)** have discretion to **accept risk and approve exceptions** to meet specific mission needs. Additionally, the use of a **Cross Domain Solution (CDS)** may introduce unique considerations that justify deviations from standard practices.

### Flux and SOPS Encryption

We recommend utilizing a more production ready approach when utilizing SOPS; the example below will showcase the use of GPG however, we would recommend using vault for on-prem or if using a cloud provider to utilize their encryption/decryption methods by following the [flux guide](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/mozilla-sops/#encrypting-secrets-using-various-cloud-providers)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to configure your own Big Bang environment using this template.

1. **Clone this repository locally**

   ```bash
   git clone https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/customers/template.git
   ```

2. **Create Your Repository:**
   - Determine where your repository will live and clone the repository locally i.e gitlab, github etc.:

     ```bash
     git clone <your-repo-url>
     cd <your-repo-name>
     ```

   - Create a working branch for your configuration changes:

     ```bash
     git checkout -b template-demo
     ```

3. **Choose Deployment Strategy:**

   This template is organized into two deployment strategy folders:
   - **`gitRepo/`**: Contains configurations for GitOps deployment using Big Bang's Git repository as the source
   - **`helmRepo/`**: Contains configurations for deployment using Big Bang's OCI Helm chart from the registry

   If you don't explicitly need the benefits of functionality offered by OCI, it is recommended to use the **gitRepo** strategy.
   - Copy the chosen strategy folder's contents to the root of your repository:

     ```bash
     # Using gitRepo (recommended)
     cp -r gitRepo/* .
     ```

     ```bash
     # OR, if using helmRepo
     cp -r helmRepo/* .
     ```

   - This will create the `base/` directory and environment folders (e.g., `dev/`, `prod/`) in your repository root.

![Clone_Repo GIF](gifs/clone_repo.gif)

1. **Configure Secrets (SOPS):**
   - **Generate GPG Key:** If you don't have one, generate a GPG key pair. This key will be used by SOPS to encrypt your secrets. See [SOPS GPG Guide](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/mozilla-sops/#generating-a-gpg-key).
   - **Update `.sops.yaml`:** Add your GPG key's fingerprint to the `.sops.yaml` file in the root of your repository. This tells SOPS which key to use for encryption/decryption.

     ```bash
     export GPG_FP="YOUR_KEY_FINGERPRINT" # Get this via 'gpg --list-keys'
     # On Linux:
     sed -i "s/pgp: FALSE_KEY_HERE/pgp: ${GPG_FP}/" .sops.yaml
     # On macOS:
     # gsed -i "s/pgp: FALSE_KEY_HERE/pgp: ${GPG_FP}/" .sops.yaml

     git add .sops.yaml
     git commit -m "chore: configure SOPS GPG key fingerprint"
     ```

   - **Encrypt Initial Secrets:**
     - This template includes a demo TLS certificate for the default domain `dev.bigbang.mil`. Encrypt the base secret file:

       ```bash
       # The base/common-bb-secret.yaml contains demo credentials and certificates
       sops --encrypt base/common-bb-secret.yaml > base/common-bb-secret.enc.yaml
       ```

     - Encrypt the environment secret file referenced by `dev/kustomization.yaml`:

       ```bash
       sops --verbose --encrypt dev/secrets/dev-bb-secret.yaml > dev/secrets/dev-bb-secret.enc.yaml
       ```

   - **Add Your Secrets:** Edit the newly created `base/common-bb-secret.enc.yaml` to add essential secrets like your Iron Bank pull credentials. Use the `sops` command, which will open the file in your default editor:

     ```bash
     sops base/common-bb-secret.enc.yaml
     ```

   - Inside the editor, add your secrets under the `stringData: "values.yaml"` key. Ensure the structure matches what Big Bang expects. The secret resource name should be `common-bb` for base secrets.

     ```yaml
     # Example structure within base/secrets.enc.yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Secret
     metadata:
       name: common-bb-secret # Use 'environment-bb' for environment-specific secrets
       namespace: bigbang
     stringData:
       values.yaml: |-
         # Add your Iron Bank credentials here
         registryCredentials:
         - registry: registry1.dso.mil
           username: your-iron-bank-username
           password: your-iron-bank-pat-or-cli-secret

         # Add other required secret values below
         # --- Existing content from bigbang-dev-cert.yaml below ---
         # (Ensure this section remains if you keep the demo cert initially)
         istioGateway:
           values:
             gateways:
               public:
                 gatewayCerts:
                 - name: public-cert
                   tls:
                     key:
     ```

   - Save and close the editor. SOPS will automatically re-encrypt the file.

   - **Commit Encrypted Secrets:**

     ```bash
     cat base/common-bb-secret.enc.yaml
     git add base/common-bb-secret.enc.yaml dev/secrets/dev-bb-secret.enc.yaml
     # Optional: Remove the unencrypted demo cert if you added your own TLS secrets
     # git rm base/common-bb-secret.yaml
     git commit -m "feat: add initial encrypted secrets (Iron Bank creds, demo TLS)"
     git push --set-upstream origin template-demo
     ```

    - **Important Security Note:** The demo TLS certificate (`base/common-bb-secret.yaml`) and its private key are public. **Do not use it for production or sensitive environments.** Replace it with your own certificate/key (added to `base/common-bb-secret.enc.yaml` or an environment-specific `environment/environment-bb-secret.enc.yaml`) or configure `cert-manager` via `configmap.yaml` values.

    - **Local Build Note:** `kustomize build`/`kubectl kustomize` will fail if referenced encrypted files are missing. Before local rendering, generate `base/common-bb-secret.enc.yaml` and `dev/secrets/dev-bb-secret.enc.yaml` (or the equivalent files for your environment).

![SOPS GIF](gifs/sops.gif)

1. **Configure Git Repository Source (Flux):**
   - Edit the `bigbang.yaml` file within your chosen environment directory (e.g., `dev/bigbang.yaml`).
   - Update `spec.url` to your **forked repository's HTTPS URL**.
   - Update `spec.ref.branch` to the name of the **working branch** you created (e.g., `template-demo`).

     ```yaml
     # Example snippet from dev/bigbang.yaml
     apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
     kind: GitRepository
     metadata:
       name: environment-repo # Name for the Flux GitRepository object
       namespace: bigbang
     spec:
       interval: 1m
       url: https://your-private-repo-domain/your-org/your-repo-name.git # <-- UPDATE THIS
       ref:
         branch: template-demo # <-- UPDATE THIS
       secretRef:
         name: private-git # Matches the secret created during deployment
     ---
     apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
     kind: Kustomization
     metadata:
       name: environment # Name for the Flux Kustomization object
       namespace: bigbang
     spec:
       interval: 5m
       path: ./dev # <-- Path within your repo (should match the directory)
       prune: true
       sourceRef:
         kind: GitRepository
         name: environment-repo # Must match the GitRepository name above
       decryption:
         provider: sops
         secretRef:
           name: sops-gpg # Matches the secret containing the GPG private key
     ```

   - Commit the change:

     ```bash
     git add dev/bigbang.yaml
     git commit -m "chore: configure flux git source for dev environment"
     git push --set-upstream origin template-demo
     ```

## Deployment

These steps deploy FluxCD to your cluster and configure it to manage your Big Bang environment based on your Git repository.

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure `kubectl` is configured to communicate with your target Kubernetes cluster.
2. **Clone Big Bang Repository:**
   - Clone down Big Bang to another directory

     ```bash
     git clone https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang.git
     ```

3. **Deploy Flux Controllers:**
   - Utilize the script within the bigbang folder to install flux with your `REGISTRY1 USERNAME` and `REGISTRY1 PASSWORD`

     ```bash
     ./bigbang/scripts/install_flux.sh -u $REGISTRY1_USERNAME -p $REGISTRY1_PASSWORD
     ```

4. **Deploy Secrets to Cluster:**
   - Create the `bigbang` namespace (Flux usually creates `flux-system`):

     ```bash
     kubectl create ns bigbang
     ```

   - **SOPS GPG Private Key:** Flux needs your GPG private key to decrypt secrets from your Git repository.

     ```bash
     # Ensure GPG_FP is set to your key fingerprint
     export GPG_FP="YOUR_KEY_FINGERPRINT"
     gpg --export-secret-key --armor "${GPG_FP}" | kubectl create secret generic sops-gpg -n bigbang --from-file=bigbangkey.asc=/dev/stdin
     ```

   - **Git Credentials:** Flux needs credentials to clone your private Git repository. Use your private git username and a PAT with `read_repository` scope.

     ```bash
      kubectl create secret generic private-git -n bigbang \
        --from-literal=username=<your-private-repo-username> \
        --from-literal=password=<your-private-repo-pat>
     ```

   - **Image Pull Credentials (helmRepo only):** If you're using the **helmRepo** deployment strategy, Flux needs registry credentials to pull the Big Bang OCI Helm chart:

     ```bash
     # Required for helmRepo deployments
     kubectl create secret docker-registry private-registry -n bigbang \
       --docker-server=registry1.dso.mil \
       --docker-username=<your-iron-bank-username> \
       --docker-password=<your-iron-bank-pat-or-cli-secret>
     ```

     This step is **not required** for gitRepo deployments.

5. **Deploy Big Bang Environment Configuration:**
   - Apply the `bigbang.yaml` file corresponding to the environment you want to deploy (e.g., `dev`):

     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f dev/bigbang.yaml
     ```

   - **Note:** The contents of `bigbang.yaml` differ based on your deployment strategy:
     - **gitRepo**: Creates Flux `GitRepository` and `Kustomization` resources
     - **helmRepo**: Creates Flux `HelmRepository`, `HelmRelease`, and `Kustomization` resources

6. **Monitor Deployment:**
   - Flux will now detect the `GitRepository` or `HelmRepository` and `Kustomization` resources, clone your repository, decrypt secrets using the `sops-gpg` secret, run Kustomize build on the specified path (`./dev`), and apply the resulting manifests (including the main Big Bang HelmRelease).
   - Check the status of Flux resources:

     ```bash
     # Check if Flux can clone your repo and process the kustomization
     kubectl get gitrepositories,kustomizations -n bigbang
     # Wait for the Kustomization to report Ready status
     kubectl wait kustomization/environment -n bigbang --for=condition=Ready --timeout=15m
     ```

   - Check the status of the Big Bang HelmRelease and its deployed packages:

     ```bash
     kubectl get helmreleases -n bigbang
     # Look for errors or progress
     kubectl describe helmrelease bigbang -n bigbang
     # Check pods across relevant namespaces (bigbang, flux-system, istio-system, etc.)
     kubectl get pods -A -w
     ```

   - Troubleshooting: Use `kubectl logs -n flux-system deploy/source-controller` or `kustomize-controller` for Flux issues. Use `kubectl describe` on failing HelmReleases or Pods.

## Customization (Kustomize Workflow)

Modify your Big Bang deployment by making changes in your Git repository. Flux will automatically apply them.

- **Modify Values:** Edit the `configmap.yaml` file in your environment overlay (e.g., `dev/configmap.yaml`) to change non-secret configurations like the domain, resource limits, or package-specific settings. Commit the changes to Git.
- **Modify Secrets:** Edit encrypted secret files (in `base/` or your environment directory) using `sops <filename>`. For example:

  ```bash
  # Edit base secrets
  sops base/common-bb-secret.enc.yaml

  # Edit environment-specific secrets
  sops dev/secrets/dev-bb-secret.enc.yaml
  ```

  Environment secrets (e.g., `dev-bb-secret`) typically override base secrets (`common-bb-secret`) if keys conflict within the `values.yaml` structure. Commit the changes after editing.

- **Enable/Disable Packages:** Most core Big Bang packages are enabled or disabled via boolean flags within the `values.yaml` structure in `configmap.yaml` (for non-secrets) or `secrets.enc.yaml` (if the package block contains secrets). For example, to enable Keycloak:

  ```yaml
  # In dev/configmap.yaml under stringData: "values.yaml":
  keycloak:
    enabled: true
  ```

  Refer to the Big Bang Package documentation for specific values.

- **Add Custom Resources/Patches:**
  - To add plain Kubernetes manifests (e.g., a ConfigMap, a Secret _not_ managed by SOPS), add the YAML file to your environment directory (e.g., `dev/my-configmap.yaml`) and list it under the `resources:` section in your environment's `kustomization.yaml` (e.g., `dev/kustomization.yaml`).
  - To apply Kustomize patches (e.g., modifying a resource deployed by Big Bang), define the patch in a file and add it to the `patchesStrategicMerge:` or `patches:` section in `dev/kustomization.yaml`.
- **Update Big Bang Version:**
  1. **For gitRepo deployments:** In `base/kustomization.yaml`, change the `?ref=X.Y.Z` tag in the `resources:` URL pointing to the Big Bang repository:

     ```yaml
     # In base/kustomization.yaml
     resources:
       # Update the tag here VVVVVVV
       - https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang.git//base?ref=NEW_VERSION_TAG
     ```

  2. **For helmRepo deployments:** Update the `spec.chart.spec.version` in the HelmRelease resource within `base/helmrelease.yaml`:

     ```yaml
     # In base/helmrelease.yaml
      spec:
        chart:
          spec:
            version: NEW_VERSION_TAG # Update this version
      ```

      In `helmRepo`, this single value also updates the Flux components source tag (`GitRepository/bigbang.spec.ref.tag`) via Kustomize replacement in `base/kustomization.yaml`.

      If an environment overlay later overrides the HelmRelease chart version for testing, also patch `GitRepository/bigbang.spec.ref.tag` in that overlay to keep Flux components and Big Bang aligned.

  3. **Update Flux Controllers:** When upgrading Big Bang significantly, you might also need to update the Flux controllers themselves by re-running `./bigbang/scripts/install_flux.sh -u $REGISTRY1_USERNAME -p $REGISTRY1_PASSWORD`
  4. Commit changes to Git. Flux will apply the updated configuration and reconcile the deployment.

## Advanced Configuration

- **Airgap/Self-Signed Git CA:**
  If your Git repository uses HTTPS with a certificate signed by a custom Certificate Authority (CA), you need to provide the CA certificate to Flux.
  1. Create a secret containing the CA certificate (and optionally, Git credentials if not using the `private-git` secret). Example structure:

     ```yaml
     # Example: my-environment/git-ca-secret.yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Secret
     metadata:
       name: git-ca-certs
       namespace: bigbang # Must be in the same namespace as the GitRepository
     stringData:
       ca.crt: |
         -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
         YOUR-CUSTOM-CA-CERT-PEM
         -----END CERTIFICATE-----
       # Optional: Add username/password if needed for this specific repo
       # username: git-user
       # password: git-password
     ```

  2. Encrypt this secret using SOPS: `sops -e -i my-environment/git-ca-secret.yaml`
  3. Add the encrypted file to your environment's `kustomization.yaml` resources list.
  4. Modify the Flux `GitRepository` definition in `my-environment/bigbang.yaml` to reference this secret:

     ```yaml
     # In my-environment/bigbang.yaml
     apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
     kind: GitRepository
     metadata:
       name: environment-repo
       namespace: bigbang
     spec:
       # ... url, ref ...
       secretRef:
         name: private-git # Still use this for standard auth if needed
       verify: # Add this section
         mode: tls
         secretRef:
           name: git-ca-certs # Reference the secret with the CA cert
     ```

## Multi-Environment Workflow

This template is designed to support multiple deployment environments (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`) from a single configuration repository.

- **Shared Configuration:** Place common Kustomize resources, ConfigMaps (`base/configmap.yaml`), and SOPS-encrypted secrets (`base/common-bb-secret.enc.yaml`) in the `base/` directory. These are included by all environment overlays by default.
- **Environment Overlays:** Create a separate directory for each environment (e.g., `dev`, `prod`).
  - Each environment directory has its own `kustomization.yaml` that includes `../../base` and adds environment-specific resources, patches, or configurations.
  - Each environment has its own `bigbang.yaml` file defining the Flux `GitRepository` or `HelmRepository` and `Kustomization` resources specific to that environment (pointing to the correct path like `./dev` or `./prod`). Deploy the appropriate `bigbang.yaml` to the cluster to manage that environment.
- **Environment-Specific Values:** Add a `configmap.yaml` and/or `secrets/<environment>-bb-secret.enc.yaml` to the environment directory (e.g., `dev/configmap.yaml`, `dev/secrets/dev-bb-secret.enc.yaml`) to provide or override values specific to that environment. Kustomize merges these with the base configurations.

## Additional SOPS Notes and Advanced Configuration

- `SOPS Note`: [Sops isn't guaranteed to preserve the yaml formatting of a file it encrypts](https://github.com/mozilla/sops/issues/864)
- `Sops Note`: sops is an abstraction layer that allows several secret backends to be used.
  - AGE and GPG (also known as PGP) are generic cloud agnostic options that have no dependencies. It's important to note that while [the sops repo recommends AGE over PGP](https://github.com/mozilla/sops#22encrypting-using-age), For DoD use cases it's preferable to use GPG, because GPG offers NIST approved crypto algorithms. (AGE is just as secure as GPG; however, AGE's crypto algorithms, X25519 and ChaCha20-Poly1305 are not NIST approved algorithms ([X25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519) is used to generate asymmetric key pairs and [ChaCha20-Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305) is a symmetric encryption algorithm. The example above has GPG leverage RSA 4096 and AES 256 which are both NIST approved)
  - GPG backed sops is shown as an example above, because it's generic and cloud agnostic.
  - If possible Cloud Service Provider based Key Management Service based solutions like AWS KMS, GCP KMS, and Azure Key Vault should be preferred over GPG, for the following reasons:
    - CSP KMS solutions are FIPS 140-2 approved
    - KMS solutions leverage identity based decryption, since the service never exposes the key and does encryption / decryption operations on behalf of users, the decryption key can't leak.
    - Identity based decryption means you can protect access to decryption rights using RBAC, and you can revoke access to the ability to decrypt data.
    - CSP KMS solutions have easy to satisfy dependencies
  - Hashicorp Vault is also a good option; however, it's worth pointing out that:
    - Using Vault means introducing Vault as a dependency, and standing up a production grade instance of Vault requires a good amount of work.
    - If a FIPS 140-2 compliant instance of Vault is needed, then Vault would need to be backed by an HSM, and that requires a Vault Enterprise License.
  - If you want to leverage a KMS based solution, you'll need to update `.sops.yaml` based on the following links:
    - [AWS KMS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops#27kms-aws-profiles)
    - [GCP KMS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops#23encrypting-using-gcp-kms)
    - [Azure Key Vault](https://github.com/mozilla/sops#24encrypting-using-azure-key-vault)
    - [Hashicorp Vault](https://github.com/mozilla/sops#25encrypting-using-hashicorp-vault)

## Renovate Bot

As outlined in the Big Bang documentation, the recommended approach is to monitor the repository managing your GitOps state (i.e., this template) using a tool like Renovate. This enables alerting and automation for updates related to both Big Bang and its associated packages.

This repository includes a [Renovate configuration example](./renovate.json) that targets Repo1 Git repositories. It supports updates for individual packages as well as the Big Bang umbrella chart by automatically generating merge requests. When using the package-based update strategy (`package-strategy`), Renovate will create separate pull/merge requests for each package.

The [Renovate Deployment documentation](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/blob/master/docs/guides/renovate/deployment.md)
provides guidance for deploying Renovate on a Big Bang cluster, enabling it to monitor both this template and dependencies in other repositories as a general-purpose capability.

After copying files from a deployment strategy directory (`gitRepo/` or `helmRepo/`) to your repository root, you should prevent Renovate from updating the original strategy template directories by adding an `ignorePaths` entry to the `renovate.json` configuration file:

```json
"ignorePaths": ["gitRepo/**", "helmRepo/**"],
```

This ensures Renovate only monitors your active deployment configurations, not the unused template folders.
